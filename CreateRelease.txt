Notes on how to create a new release version

1. Ensure that all changes have been committed and pushed
2. Update the version number in moamosaic/__init__.py
3. Update the release notes (docs/releasenotes.md) to describe what
   changes are a part of this release. Go through the git logs to check
   what has changed since the last release.
4. Re-build the documentation (docs/buildDoc.py)
5. Commit and push these changes (probably as a pull request)
6. Checkout a clean copy of the repository into a temp directory,
   and "cd" into it.
7. Create the tar.gz with "python -m build". This will go into
   a build/ subdirectory
8. Go to the Github Releases page for the repo
       https://github.com/ubarsc/moamosaic/releases
   and press "Draft a new release". You should then fill in
       Tag version: moamosaic-A.B.C
       Release Title: Version A.B.C
       Description: Add a brief description (a few lines at most) explaining
                    the key points about this release.
       Upload files: Add the tar.gz
       Click "Publish release"
